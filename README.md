call native function `startActivity` in react-native

isPackageInstalled and isAppInstalled method is to check to see if the app is installed
openApp and startAppByPackageName method will run the app when it is installed.

## Why Fork

Original Repository is [react-native-intent-launcher](https://github.com/poberwong/react-native-intent-launcher)

Fixes the following issues when building React Native 0.60 or later.

```
WARNING: Configuration 'compile' is obsolete and has been replaced with 'implementation' and 'api'.
It will be removed at the end of 2018. For more information see: http://d.android.com/r/tools/update-dependency-configurations.html
```

And

Added isPackageInstalled, openApp method

Use isPackageInstalled method when isAppInstalled method doesn't work.

Use openApp method when startAppByPackageName method doesn't work.

## Description
You can call native function `startActivity` in react-native to do something with `Intent` which can only be solved with android native code

## Installation

Using yarn (RN 0.60 and and above)

```console
yarn add react-native-android-intent-launcher
```

Using yarn (RN 0.59 and and below)

```console
yarn add react-native-android-intent-launcher
react-native link react-native-android-intent-launcher
```

## Usage

```javascript
import { Linking } from 'react-native'
import IntentLauncher, { IntentConstant } from 'react-native-intent-launcher'

...

IntentLauncher.startActivity({
	action: 'android.settings.APPLICATION_DETAILS_SETTINGS',
	data: 'package:com.example'
})

// check if app is installed by package name
IntentLauncher.isAppInstalled('com.your.app')
  .then((result) => {
    console.log('isAppInstalled yes');
  })
  .catch((error) => console.warn('isAppInstalled: no', error));

// open another app by package name
IntentLauncher.startAppByPackageName('com.your.app')
  .then((result) => {
    console.log('startAppByPackageName started');
  })
  .catch((error) => console.warn('startAppByPackageName: could not open', error));

const downloadURL = "https://www.your.com/download"

IntentLauncher.isPackageInstalled('com.your.app')
  .then(isInstalled => {
    if (isInstalled) 
      IntentLauncher.openApp(appInfo.package, options)
    else if (downloadURL) 
      Linking.openURL(downloadURL)
        .catch(err => console.error("An error occurred", err))
    else
      console.log("There is no path to download the app")
  })

...
```
